	<A NAME = "COMPUTER"></A>
<p align="10%">A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a program, make computers very applicable to a wide range of tasks. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. </p>	
<H3><b>CPU</b></H3>
<A NAME = "CPU"></A>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. </p>
<h3><b>ALU</b></h3>
	<A NAME = "ALU"></A>
<p>The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.[59] The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc.</p>
<H1>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</H1>
<H3>C</H3>
	<A NAME = "COMPUTER"></A>
<P>C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and C compilrs available for the majority of available architecture and operating systems</P>
<H3>C++</H3>
	<A NAME = "c++"></A>
<P>C++ (pronounced cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
</P>
<H1><B>DBMS</B></H1>
	<A NAME = "DBMS"></A>
<H3>RDBMS</H3>
	<A NAME = "RDBMS"></A>
<P>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2017, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.</P>
<h3><B>OODBMS</h3>
<A NAME = "OODBMS"></A>
<P>An object database (also object-oriented database management system, OODBMS) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.</P>
